      <p class="larger">Here are several examples of different uses of Convergence.  We have found that most developers can find something here related to their specific use case.  <a href="https://forum.convergence.io">Go here</a> to suggest additional examples, or better yet, add your own to <a href="https://github.com/convergencelabs/examples/">this repository</a>!</p>
      <p><em>Each example has a <strong>Share <i class="far fa-share-square"></i></strong> button, which will give you a URL to share with others to use the example together (or you can simply open the example in two windows yourself).</em></p>

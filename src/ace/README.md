This exmaple demostrates a bare-bones collaborative text editor implemented with the [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/). Ace is a popular editor and we have developed some utilities that make using Ace in a collaborative mode much easier. We call these the [Ace Collaborative Extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convergence/ace-collab-ext). This example uses those extensions and integrates them with Convergence to provice a collaborative code editor in a relatively small amount of code.

Features include:
- Collaborative Text Editing
- Shared cursors
- Shared selections
- A radar view for seeing remove scroll and cursor positions.

Enjoy.

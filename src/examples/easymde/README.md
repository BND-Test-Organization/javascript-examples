# Collaborative Easy Markdown Editor

This example demonstrates a robust Markdown editor using the [Easy Markdown Editor](https://easymde.tk/). EasyMDE is a simple, embeddable, and rich JS markdown editor that styles Markdown text as you write. EasyMDE uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) under the hood. As such, we were able to leverage our [CodeMirror Collaborative Extensions](https://github.com/convergencelabs/codemirror-collab-extt) to provide a collaborative markdown editor in a relatively small amount of code.

Features include:
- Collaborative Markdown Editing
- Shared cursors
- Shared selections

# Collaborative CodeMirror Editor

This example demonstrates a bare-bones collaborative text editor implemented with the [CodeMirror Editor](https://codemirror.net/). CodeMirror is a popular open source editor used in a variety of applications.  We have developed some utilities that make using CodeMirror in a collaborative mode much easier. We call these the [CodeMirror Collaborative Extensions](https://github.com/convergencelabs/codemirror-collab-extt). This example uses those extensions and integrates them with Convergence to provide a collaborative code editor in a relatively small amount of code.

Features include:
- Collaborative Text Editing
- Shared cursors
- Shared selections

Enjoy.

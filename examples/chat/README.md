# Overview

This example demonstrates a simple chat room use case.  Users can join any chat room they like and send messages to other users in the chat room.

# Persistence

At this time, chat messages are transient, so you won't see any message history, just incoming messages when you are actually in the chat "room".  We will be adding persistence soon, don't worry ;)
